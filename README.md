# NYC Yellow Taxi EDA ‚Äì 2023

## üìå Objective
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on New York City Yellow Taxi ride data for the year 2023.  
The goal is to demonstrate why EDA is a crucial step in the **data science** and **machine learning** workflow, uncover patterns and trends, and generate actionable insights for taxi operations.

## üìä Dataset Description

The **Yellow Taxi Trip Records** dataset contains information on pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, trip distances, fares, rate types, payment types, and passenger counts.

- **Source:** [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)  
- **Data Format:** Parquet (`.parquet`)  
- **Time Range:** January 2023 ‚Äì December 2023  
- **Data Fields:** See [Data Dictionary](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf)  

Key columns include:
- `tpep_pickup_datetime`, `tpep_dropoff_datetime`
- `passenger_count`, `trip_distance`
- `PULocationID`, `DOLocationID`
- `fare_amount`, `tip_amount`, `total_amount`
- `payment_type`, `RatecodeID`
- `airport_fee`, `congestion_surcharge`, `MTA_tax`, `extra`

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### **1. Data Sampling**
- Loaded monthly Parquet files for 2023  
- Applied **hourly stratified sampling (5%)** to create a representative dataset  
- Combined sampled data into a single DataFrame  

### **2. Data Cleaning**
- Fixed inconsistent columns (e.g., `airport_fee` merge)  
- Removed negative and unrealistic values  
- Imputed missing values:
  - **Passenger count:** random weighted sampling from observed distribution  
  - **RatecodeID & congestion_surcharge:** filled with median values  
- Removed outliers in trip distance, fare amount, and tip amount  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Time-based demand analysis (hourly, daily, monthly)  
- Revenue trends & seasonal patterns  
- Fare vs. distance and fare vs. duration relationships  
- Payment type distribution  
- Geospatial analysis with NYC taxi zones shapefile  
- Passenger count patterns across time and zones  
- Surcharge frequency and impact

## üìà Key Insights

- **Peak Demand Hours:** 5 PM ‚Äì 7 PM on weekdays, steady leisure demand on weekends  
- **Busiest Zones:** Midtown Manhattan, JFK Airport, LaGuardia Airport  
- **Revenue Trends:** Q2 and Q4 have highest revenues; higher fares in afternoon/evening  
- **Fare Structure:** Strong correlation between distance and fare; short trips have higher cost per mile  
- **Payment Methods:** Majority via credit card (>90%)  
- **Tipping Behavior:** Evening trips see higher tip percentages
